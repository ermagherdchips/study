            Hi!
            I'm Amie, and I am currently looking for people like you to participate in my PhD research project.
            It's exploring the academic and personal experiences of <span class="font-weight-normal">students who are 'estranged', meaning they have a strained relationship with their family</span> and may not have any contact with them.
          </p>
          
          <p class="card-text lead">
            Specifically, I'm looking for <span class="font-weight-normal">people studying at universities in England on any undergraduate course</span>.
            You need to have been at uni for at least a year already and not be graduating this year.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text lead">
            <span class="font-weight-normal">This is a year-long study made up of 4 waves</span>.
            The first wave begins in late 2020, and the final wave ends in September 2021.
            In each wave, you'll write diary entries and take part in an interview with me about your university experiences.
            Everything will be online.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text lead">
            By choosing to share your experiences, you'll make a positive change for current and future university students.
            As a thank you, you'll receive a <span class="font-weight-normal">£20 voucher at the end of each wave</span> you participate in.

          <h2 class="card-title">About Me</h2>

          <p class="card-text">
            My name is <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/education/staff/profile/?id=18506">Amie Waterman</a>.
            I'm a 2<sup>nd</sup> year PhD student at Durham University, based in the School of Education.
            I'm interested in improving student experiences in higher education, particularly for students who are studying without family support.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            This topic is personal to me because I am an estranged student myself: I became estranged from my family in my first term of university.
            During my undergraduate, masters, and PhD so far, my lack of a traditional family support network has caused various challenges.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            In my third year of university, I began working to raise awareness of family estrangement and improve estranged students' experiences.
            I founded <a href="https://www.facebook.com/durhamestranged">Durham Estranged Students</a>, a network for care-experienced and estranged students, and worked with staff to improve university policy and support.
            Nationally, I've campaigned with the estrangement charity <a href="https://www.standalone.org.uk/">Stand Alone</a>, speaking on the BBC and at various conferences.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            As an Education student, it inevitably became a research interest too!
            For my <a href="Dissertation.pdf">undergraduate dissertation</a>, I interviewed estranged students about their university experiences so far.
            In contrast, my PhD explores the full estranged student experience for as it happens.
            It aims to make the UK's higher education system better for students like us.

      <h2 class="display-4 mt-4">About the Study</h2>

      <div class="card text-justify my-4">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h3 class="card-title">Purpose</h3>

          <p class="card-text">
            The aim of this study is to explore undergraduate estranged students’ academic and personal experiences of higher education.
            The study will take place from November 2020 until September 2021, and the study is interested in capturing how estranged students experience higher education across an academic year and its vacations.
            It aims to gather a deeper understanding of estranged students’ experiences across the year to inform university and national policy to support students without family support.

      <div class="card text-justify my-4">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h3 class="card-title">Who is eligible?</h3>

          <p class="card-text">
            To be eligible to participate in this study, you must:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Be an undergraduate student studying any course at an English university</li>
            <li>Have been at university for at least a year already and not have graduated by September 2021</li>
            <li>Self-idenfify as having little/no support from your family (estranged)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="card text-justify my-4">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h3 class="card-title">What will happen?</h3>

          <p class="card-text">
            If you agree to take part in the study, you will be invited to participate in different online activities from the point of recruitment until September 2021.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            You will first be asked to take part in an online briefing interview (either via Zoom, Skype, or Microsoft Teams).
            In this interview, you will be asked some questions about yourself, your family relationships, and to reflect on your university experiences so far.
            The interview also acts as an opportunity for you to ask questions, and to introduce you to the diary platform that will be used throughout the study.
            This interview will last around 1 hour.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            The study will then take place across four waves which you will be invited to participate in.
            These waves take place during the 2020/21 academic year and its vacation periods:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Wave 1: November 2020 – January 2021</li>
            <li>Wave 2: February 2021 – April 2021</li>
            <li>Wave 3: May 2021 – June 2021</li>
            <li>Wave 4: July 2021 – September 2021</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="card-text">
            In each wave, you will be asked to write short diary entries about your recent university experiences.
            You can write as many entries as you like, but at least one per month.
            These will be submitted via an online diary platform, which is introduced in the briefing interview.
            While there will be some guiding questions, you are able to write about any aspect of your university experience that you feel comfortable sharing.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            At the end of each wave, you will be asked to participate in an online interview on whatever platform you feel comfortable using.
            In these interviews, we will discuss your diary entries written in this wave and ask further questions about your university experiences.
            These interviews will last around 1 hour.
            You can decline any questions that you don't want to answer, or end the interview early, without giving a reason.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            Overall, full participation in the study would involve 5 interviews and at least 9 diary entries across a 10-month timeline.
            You will receive a thank-you payment of a £20 voucher for each wave you participate in. This will be paid to you after the interview has taken place.
          </p>

      <div class="card text-justify my-4">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h3 class="card-title">Do I have to take part?</h3>

          <p class="card-text">
            Your participation is voluntary, and you do not have to agree to take part.
            If you do agree to take part, you can withdraw at any time without giving a reason.
            You are also able to withdraw temporarily from the study at any point, and re-return later in the study if you wish.
            Your rights in relation to withdrawing any data that is identifiable to you are explained in the <a href="Privacy_Notice.pdf">Privacy Notice</a>.

          <h3 class="card-title">Are there any potential risks involved?</h3>

          <p class="card-text">
            It is possible that talking about and reflecting on your university experiences may involve encountering difficult topics and experiencing negative emotions and feelings.
            These may include, but are not exclusive to, your financial situation, unwanted family contact, accommodation issues and homelessness, mental health concerns, and stigmatisation within your university.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            If you experience distress during any of the research activities, you are free to stop and not complete it, without negative consequence.
            You are able to complete your diary entries and interviews in a space and time that you are comfortable with, and you are able to decline any questions without giving reason.
            You are also free to withdraw from the study, either temporarily or fully, without negative consequence.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            After each interview, and at any time on request, you will be signposted to resources for support avenues locally and nationally.
            Your voice and experiences are valued.
            Your participation in this study provides greater understanding of estranged students’ experiences and helps to make positive change in universities for current and future estranged students.
